# pre-commit-matlab
A collection of [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks for MATLAB

Ok... it's just one hook so far but maybe someday there will be more ðŸ˜ƒ

## Using pre-commit-matlab with pre-commit
Add this to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

```yaml
-   repo: https://github.com/sco1/pre-commit-matlab
    rev: v1.0.0
    hooks:
    -   id: matlab-reflow-comments
        args: [--line-length=100]
```

## Hooks
### `matlab-reflow-comments`
Reflow comments (lines beginning with `%`) in MATLAB file(s) (`*.m`) to the specified line length.

Blank comment lines are passed back into the reformatted source code.

* Specify line length with `args: [--line-length=100]` (Default: `75`)
* Ignore comments with inner indentation `args: [--ignore-indented=True]` (Default: `True`)

If `ignore_indented` is `True`, comments that contain inner indentation of at least two spaces
is passed back into the reformatted source code as-is. Leading whitespace in the line is not
considered.

For example:
  ```matlab
      % This is not indented
  % This is not indented
  %  This is indented
  %    This is indented
  ```
